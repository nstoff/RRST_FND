The patient do all the experiments in his rollchair. The distance between the screen and eyes has been check. However, there is a lot of high frequency noise in the EEG signal. 
It could come from the metalic structure of the chair. 

For the RRST:
The patient was not able to manage to response to the mouse. He gave instruction to the experimenter about the response. It means that the RT is not usable and the evaluation scale about the confidence neither.

For HEP: 
The patient was not able to use the keyboard. He dictate his anwer to the operactor which validated the response (reation time not realable). 

For HEP and CAS:
The patient complain that the sound was only on the right ear and not the left ear. After test in laborabory, it seems that it was because of a too weak volume and a 
incorrect installation od the left ear bulb. 
However, the audio cable has been replace (and timing tested) with the new audio prolongation cable Ã  5m.
