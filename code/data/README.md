 In this folder, we provide part of the data, that lead to the results published in our manuscript in anonymized format. 
 Note that this is an INCOMPLETE dataset. The data of some participants were deleted, as for these participants the informed consent form was signed solely for this study, and these participants did NOT agree on the re-use of the data for further projects. Thus, we are not able to share their anonymized data. All participants that signed the informed consent on the further use of their data can be found here uploaded as anonymized data.
